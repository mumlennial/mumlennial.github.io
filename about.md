Hello and welcome! We began as a family of 2 Australian expats living in America, New York City (Brooklyn!) specifically. Our two boys were both born in Manhattan and as of this writing only one of them is officially Australian (better get on that paperwork for the baby...).

America is where we are raising our children and it's often really hard to be so far away from the familiarities of our home country and of course our family. Whilst Australian and American cultures are similar in many ways, in other they are vastly different and at times I can become overwhelmed with homesickness.
