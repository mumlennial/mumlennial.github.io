We both work at companies with generous parental leave policies and decided to go traveling for part of it! I needed to renew my visa at a consulate outside of the USA anyway and we had two weddings to attend a month apart in England so we decided to turn it into one long romp around Europe.\n\n",

We both work at companies with generous parental leave policies and decided to go traveling for part of it! I needed to renew my visa at a consulate outside of the USA anyway and we had two weddings to attend a month apart in England so we decided to turn it into one long romp around Europe.\n\nThe travel plan so far is Iceland &gt; Brighton Beach (England) &gt; Paris &gt; Fontainebleu &gt; London &gt; Dublin &gt; Menton (France) &gt; Berlin &gt; Amsterdam &gt; Alnwick (England) &gt; Iceland &gt; USA. Our families will be joining us for parts of it - for the most part we’ve booked large air bnb houses. It’s a HUGE adventure and we are so lucky to be able to even pull off such a thing. Traveling with kiddos can be challenging but I know we’ll have a blast too. We haven’t seen some of our Aussie family members for over a year.\n\nThe image above is of a river that runs through Fontainebleu which is a small town about 45 mins south of France. It’s a European boudlering mecca and super family friendly. This photo was taken on our last trip there back in 2017 when D was only 5 months old, it will be fun to return again as this time he might be able to try out some climbing!\n",

    "content": "We began as a family of 2 Australian expats living in America, New York City (Brooklyn!) specifically. Our two boys were both born in Manhattan and as of this writing only one of them is officially Australian (better get on that paperwork for the baby…).\nI’ve started this blog as a means to keep our families back home updated on our lives and as a place to be a little creative.\n\nAmerica is where we are raising our children and it’s often really hard to be so far away from the familiarities of our home country and of course our family. Whilst Australian and American cultures are similar in many ways, in other they are vastly different and it can sometimes feel isolating, confusing and I can become overwhelmed with homesickness. I probably should have started this 5 years ago at the start of our expat life but here we are anyway.\n",
