I thought I’d take some time now, 9 months on, to benchmark our portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we started off by purchasing the stocks that make up the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 20 (weighted by market cap). Then over the course of this year when added 15 more stocks to the initial 20, we just worked our way down the greater S&amp;amp;P/ASX 300 list and tried to skew a little more away from finance as the 45% of the socks in the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 20 are in finance and we felt a little over exposed. Additionally we tried to choose stocks that paid a dividend about the rate of inflation. I think actually my mum had told me about this technique and I just kind of went with it without really thinking about it more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did we do? Well the markets have been generous in 2019 and our portfolio is up 11.25% since we started down this path. The index was at 3,265 end of January this year and as of mid November its 3,745 which is an increased of 14.7%. Remember our portfolio did grow from the original 20 stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be transferring a chunk of money back into Australia soon and have decided to expand to the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 50, and will just straight up use the market cap to weight the portfolio rather than looking at dividend yields etc. This will keep things simple and we just don’t know enough about picking stocks ourselves so following an index just seems “easy”. I do wish we could just buy some VAS instead of incur all these extra brokerage fees and the hassle of managing the portfolio, however this really is our only option if we want to continue to invest back in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="PFIC" /><category term="tax" /><category term="investment" /><category term="asx" /><category term="benchmark" /><category term="portfolio" /><summary type="html">In January I wrote about how we were investing in individual stocks that make up the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 20 rather than an index fund or an LIC in order to comply with tax reporting regulations here in the US.

We both work at companies with generous parental leave policies and decided to go traveling for part of it! I needed to renew my visa at a consulate outside of the USA anyway and we had two weddings to attend a month apart in England so we decided to turn it into one long romp around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The travel plan so far is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Iceland &amp;gt; Brighton Beach (England) &amp;gt; Paris &amp;gt; Fontainebleu &amp;gt; London &amp;gt; Dublin &amp;gt; Menton (France) &amp;gt; Berlin &amp;gt; Amsterdam &amp;gt; Alnwick (England) &amp;gt; Iceland &amp;gt; USA&lt;/code&gt;. Our families will be joining us for parts of it - for the most part we’ve booked large air bnb houses. It’s a HUGE adventure and we are so lucky to be able to even pull off such a thing. Traveling with kiddos can be challenging but I know we’ll have a blast too. We haven’t seen some of our Aussie family members for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image above is of a river that runs through Fontainebleu which is a small town about 45 mins south of France. It’s a European boudlering mecca and super family friendly. This photo was taken on our last trip there back in 2017 when D was only 5 months old, it will be fun to return again as this time he might be able to try out some climbing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In just a few days we will be jetting off to start a 2 month trip through Europe.

It’s a spreadsheet I have lovingly spent hours finessing and improving. Given we have finances spread across two countries it can be a little complicated to get the full picture but I think I’ve gotten the spreadsheet to a point where its easy to see how we are tracking across all of our cash, investments and retirement accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past month I added a new data point: our savings rate. Your savings rate is the percentage of money you earn that you didn’t spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Savings Rate = (Income - Expenses)/Income * 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s say in February you earned $10000, and all your expenses added up to $8000, the savings rate is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(10000 - 8000)/10000 * 100 = 20%&lt;/code&gt;. A 20% savings rate is nothing to sneeze at!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this month right next to where I track our income and categorised expenses, I calculated our savings rate and was a little shocked. It was only 0.63%! We were essentially breaking even! Ouch. It hurts to look at how low this percentage is but not as much as it hurt when I back calculated our savings rate to when I began tracking our income and expenses in November 2018… we were spending more than we earned! Double ouch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what my savings rate looks like:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Savings_Rate_Feb2019.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really helped to visually see how much we were savings as a precent of our income. The more we can save, the earlier we can retire. So I’ve set ourselves a goal of saving 10% each month (the green line in the chart). I know, I know, 10% feels really low but you have to start somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll post our progress at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being somewhat of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/&quot;&gt;Boglehead&lt;/a&gt; my first inclination was to invest everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?overview&quot;&gt;VAS&lt;/a&gt; the Vanguard ETF which tracks the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 300 Index. I talked to my tax accountant who is an Aussie herself but has been living and working in LA and specialises in Aussie expats living over here in the US to see if there would be any tax implications with this approach. She advised me that since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008&quot;&gt;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/a&gt; the US has imposed some a number of reporting requirements for US residents who have foreign bank accounts and investments and that index funds are classified as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thunfinancial.com/home/american-expat-financial-advice-research-articles/why-americans-should-never-ever-own-shares-in-a-non-us-incorporated-mutual-fund/&quot;&gt;PFIC&lt;/a&gt; (Passive Foreign Investment Company). This type of investment not only meant high taxation rates but remaining in compliance was a very onerous task (IRS estimates it will take a person 40 hours or more to fill out one PFIC form) which would cost me more in accountant fees than I would receive in profit! Good to know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I quickly scratched that idea and looked for an alternative way to get a slice of the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 300 Index. Being a longtime &lt;a href=&quot;https://barefootinvestor.com/&quot;&gt;Barefoot Investor&lt;/a&gt; fan, I had already heard about a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afi.com.au/Investment-performance.aspx&quot;&gt;Australian Foundation Investment Company&lt;/a&gt;. Scott Pape &lt;a href=&quot;https://barefootinvestor.com/how-to-invest-guide/listed-investment-companies/&quot;&gt;has recommended them&lt;/a&gt; for a long time to folks who are new to investing and want to get started. From their website AFIC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a diversified portfolio numbering around 100 of Australia’s major companies (gets me the diversification aspect I’m after)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;management fees - 0.14% for the financial year to 30 June 2018 (low fees, in fact its the same as VAS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a dividend reinvestment plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that AFIC was a Listed Investment Company so I wanted to double check it wasn’t also considered a PFIC and turns out it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlaswealth.com.au/big-tax-bills-surfacing-for-expat-clients/&quot;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; :( Back to the drawing board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it seems I’m going to just have to build up a diversified portfolio of individual stocks in order to remain in compliance. A portfolio of a slice of the top 20 companies of the ASX (all bluechip companies with a solid track record) seems like a good plan so my first stop was to see how the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 20 tracked against the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 300 Index (my original desired portfolio). Jumping over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS781US781&amp;amp;tbm=fin&amp;amp;q=INDEXASX:+XTL&amp;amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNjJNNqyoLeAA_9trYOgAAAA&amp;amp;biw=1527&amp;amp;bih=762#scso=_e9BFXJPaL8K0_AaC6pDoBg2:0&amp;amp;smids=/m/03gv32v&amp;amp;wptab=COMPARE&quot;&gt;Google Finance&lt;/a&gt; I made this comparison chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ASX20vASX300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS781US781&amp;amp;tbm=fin&amp;amp;q=INDEXASX:+XTL&amp;amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNjJNNqyoLeAA_9trYOgAAAA&amp;amp;biw=1527&amp;amp;bih=762#scso=_e9BFXJPaL8K0_AaC6pDoBg2:0&amp;amp;smids=/m/03gv32v&amp;amp;wptab=COMPARE&quot;&gt;Google Finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As predicted it tracks the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 300 quite closely and event looks like it trends a little higher (I kinda expected it to have higher highs and lower lows but it doesn’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out that there was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackrock.com/au/individual/products/251921/ishares-ishares-s-and-p-asx-20-etf?locale=en_AU&amp;amp;switchLocale=y&amp;amp;siteEntryPassthrough=true&quot;&gt;iShares ETF&lt;/a&gt; that tracked this index, so I figured I would just use their weightings in my own portfolio. The holdings look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS5uog_dKUbkWn-7iwq-ZxvtWUs69uu5ePT-dbHsSf6vh0f3Yfboello9JyB2wlRch2E8_WdaK7EsOV/pubhtml?gid=2077100303&amp;amp;single=true&amp;amp;widget=true&amp;amp;headers=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this plan of course wouldn’t be a great idea if you only had a few thousand to invest as its going to incur higher brokerage fees than just trading on a single index ETF. I trade with CMC so my brokerage will be 11 x 20 = ~$220AUD (some trades will be higher if they are over a certain amount). The downside of maintaining my own portfolio is that it will be much harder to keep in balance of these ratios when I want to buy/sell but as owning individual stocks is my only option, I’m ok with this compromise. I’ll plan on signing up for DRP on each of the stocks that offer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my current investment plan for the money I have in Australia but I do like to quantify decisions with numbers so lets take a look at my two options, option A leave the money in a high interest savings account and option B investment in the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 20. We can assume it will be a longterm investment 5 years and for examples sake we’ll use $100 000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option A: high interest savings account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
amount: $100 000&lt;br /&gt;
interest rate: 2.87% p.a&lt;br /&gt;
amount after 5 years: $115,411&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option B: investment in the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Past performance is no indicator of future performance however we do know that given enough time the stock market always goes up. I found the below 5 year annualized rate of return on &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-asx-20&quot;&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt; (I believe this rate includes dividends as well as capital growth).&lt;br /&gt;
amount: $100 000&lt;br /&gt;
past 5 year annualized return: 4.76%&lt;br /&gt;
estimated amount after 5 years: $126,176.20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be interesting too, to compare performance against the S&amp;amp;P 500:

&lt;p&gt;I’m a long term investor in the stock market and am happy to ride out any troughs so it makes sense to me to have my money work for me in the stock market instead of leaving it in a high interest savings account. Also it’s worth pointing out that inflation in Australia is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/inflation-cpi&quot;&gt;around 2%&lt;/a&gt; so leaving the money in UBank doesn’t grow it by very much at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="PFIC" /><category term="tax" /><category term="investment" /><category term="asx" /><category term="portfolio" /><summary type="html">Being an expat means juggling finances across two countries, until now I haven’t really being paying attention to my money in Australia but since I’ve recently been educating myself on the FIRE movement, I wanted to make sure I was putting my Australian dollars to work.</summary></entry></feed>
