In just a few days we will be jetting off to start a 2 month trip through Europe. We both work at companies with generous parental leave policies and decided to go traveling for part of it! I needed to renew my visa at a consulate outside of the USA anyway and we had two weddings to attend a month apart in England so we decided to turn it into one long romp around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The travel plan so far is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Iceland &amp;gt; Brighton Beach (England) &amp;gt; Paris &amp;gt; Fontainebleu &amp;gt; London &amp;gt; Dublin &amp;gt; Menton (France) &amp;gt; Berlin &amp;gt; Amsterdam &amp;gt; Alnwick (England) &amp;gt; Iceland &amp;gt; USA&lt;/code&gt;. Our families will be joining us for parts of it - for the most part we’ve booked large air bnb houses. It’s a HUGE adventure and we are so lucky to be able to even pull off such a thing. Traveling with kiddos can be challenging but I know we’ll have a blast too. We haven’t seen some of our Aussie family members for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image above is of a river that runs through Fontainebleu which is a small town about 45 mins south of France. It’s a European boudlering mecca and super family friendly. This photo was taken on our last trip there back in 2017 when D was only 5 months old, it will be fun to return again as this time he might be able to try out some climbing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Why hello there, here I am writing this blog’s very first post!
