In just a few days we will be jetting off to start a 2 month trip through Europe. We both work at companies with generous parental leave policies and decided to go traveling for part of it! I needed to renew my visa at a consulate outside of the USA anyway and we had two weddings to attend a month apart in England so we decided to turn it into one long romp around Europe.

The travel plan so far is `Iceland > Brighton Beach (England) > Paris > Fontainebleu > London > Dublin > Menton (France) > Berlin > Amsterdam > Alnwick (England) > Iceland > USA`. Our families will be joining us for parts of it - for the most part we've booked large air bnb houses. It's a HUGE adventure and we are so lucky to be able to even pull off such a thing. Traveling with kiddos can be challenging but I know we'll have a blast too. We haven't seen some of our Aussie family members for over a year.

The image above is of a river that runs through Fontainebleu which is a small town about 45 mins south of France. It's a European boudlering mecca and super family friendly. This photo was taken on our last trip there back in 2017 when D was only 5 months old, it will be fun to return again as this time he might be able to try out some climbing!
