Every month I update our personal net worth spreadsheet. It's a spreadsheet I have lovingly spent hours finessing and improving. Given we have finances spread across two countries it can be a little complicated to get the full picture but I think I've gotten the spreadsheet to a point where its easy to see how we are tracking across all of our cash, investments and retirement accounts.

This past month I added a new data point: our savings rate. Your savings rate is the percentage of money you earn that you didn't spend.
```
Savings Rate = (Income - Expenses)/Income * 100
```
So let's say in February you earned $10000, and all your expenses added up to $8000, the savings rate is: `(10000 - 8000)/10000 * 100 = 20%`. A 20% savings rate is nothing to sneeze at!

So this month right next to where I track our income and categorised expenses, I calculated our savings rate and was a little shocked. It was only 0.63%! We were essentially breaking even! Ouch. It hurts to look at how low this percentage is but not as much as it hurt when I back calculated our savings rate to when I began tracking our income and expenses in November 2018... we were spending more than we earned! Double ouch!

Here's what my savings rate looks like:

It really helped to visually see how much we were savings as a precent of our income. The more we can save, the earlier we can retire. So I've set ourselves a goal of saving 10% each month (the green line in the chart). I know, I know, 10% feels really low but you have to start somewhere!

I'll post our progress at the end of March.

What's your savings rate?
